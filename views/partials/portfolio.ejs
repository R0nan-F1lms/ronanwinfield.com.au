        <h2>Custom Web Application</h2>
        <p>This web application was developed as part of my Diploma project. It utilised C# and Razor Pages to create an ordering system for a fictional restaurant, complete with full database integration using MSSQL. The system featured account management for staff, guest accounts, and customer reservations. Users could create accounts or book reservations as guests, and the system would automatically send confirmation emails with reservation details. Additionally, I designed and managed the underlying database to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.</p>

      <h2>Mobile App Development React.js</h2>
      <p>This mobile application was developed using React.js as part of a project during my diploma studies. It was designed for the fictional company Beanscene to streamline the ordering process for restaurant staff. The app allows waiters to use tablets to take customer orders, view cooking times, and manage table assignments. The system leverages REST APIs to ensure future integration with security vendors, enhancing long-term scalability and security. Additionally, it utilises local storage and caching, enabling staff to browse and view menu items even during network disruptions. A notification system alerts staff when the network connection is lost, ensuring seamless communication.</p>

        <h2>Mobile App Development C#</h2>
        <p>This mobile application was developed during my Certificate IV in IT as a staff management system. The application required staff members to sign in securely, after which they could manage staff accounts, add new accounts, and communicate via an internal staff intranet. This project specifically focused on building and streamlining the staff management functionality. The application was built using C# MAUI (Multi-platform App UI), which was an ideal choice due to its ability to create cross-platform applications with a single codebase. This ensured the app could run efficiently on both Android and iOS devices, reducing development time and increasing maintainability. Additionally, C# MAUI's performance and native integration with various platforms made it a robust and scalable solution for mobile application development.</p>
